* Purpose

This repo shows that the  GCC compilation option "-fsanitize=address" detects an array-index-out-of-bounds bug. The same bug can not be detected without the compiler option. 

* How

Run "make" to compile src/foo.c with the sanitizer. A run-time  error will be expected. Then, run "make demo_without_sanitizer" to see results without the sanitizer. 

* Detail

See Makefile for the command line. See src/foo.c for the buggy code.
